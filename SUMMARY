Advanced terminal-based selection tool.

The items to be selected can come from a file or from the standard input.
The selected item is printed on the standard output.

The items are often ordinary words, but can be more complex.

The selection area can be browsed easily and even disappear once the
selection is made.

Initially designed to facilitate the creation of menus, smenu quickly
became a much more general selection tool.
